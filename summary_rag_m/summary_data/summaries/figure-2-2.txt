The image is a black and white drawing of a trash can, which appears to be empty. The trash bin occupies the majority of the space in the image. In addition, there are two smaller dotted figures visible in the background, although their purpose is unclear from the current context. 
The overall composition of the image seems to focus on the garbage bin as its main subject.
